## ResNet
[[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf)

A training of deeper neural networks are difficult because of the vanishing gradient problem in gradient-based learning methods and backpropagation. A residual learning framework ease the training of networks that are substantially deep.

# Pose estimation
Pose estimation refers to computer vision techniques that detect human figures in images and videos, so that one could determine, for example, where someoneâ€™s elbow shows up in an image.

## OpenPose

OpenPose provides a real-time method for Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation based on its bottom-up approach instead of detection-based approach.

The feature maps obtained by the first 10 layers of VGG-19 model are processed with multiple stages CNN to generate a set of Part Confidence Maps and a set of Part Affinity Fields (PAFs). They are then used in a greedy algorithm to obtain the poses for each person in the image.
