## Decision boundary
Neural networks can be viewed as a universal approximation function. Let's use a simple dataset called Spiral to see how neural net can obtain a non-linear decision boundary.

### Usage
Following are the commands used to train and test the model:

```bash
$ python spiral.py
```

### Result
Following is the decision boundary obtained. We can observe that the network could fit the non-linear dataset.
