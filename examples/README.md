## Reinforcement Learning
*Reinforcement Learning* named after operant conditioning, a method of learning that occurs through rewards and punishments for behavior, presented by B. F. Skinner. Skinner studied operant conditioning by conducting animal experiments using a 'Skinner Box' shown in the figure below.
