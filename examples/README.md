## Supervised Learning 
In *supervised learning*, a teacher shows the desired solution or points out the mistake in order to help a learner to obtain the solution for a given task.

## Reinforcement Learning
*Reinforcement Learning* named after operant conditioning, a method of learning that occurs through rewards and punishments for behavior, presented by B.F. Skinner. Skinner studied operant conditioning by conducting animal experiments using a 'Skinner Box' shown in the figure below.
