## Introduction
Animals, including humans, change their behavior through experience. It is said that the brain has three types of leaning system: supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised leaning.

## [Reinforcement Learning](/examples/reinforcement_learning)
*Reinforcement Learning* is a machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences. Reinforcement Learning named after operant conditioning, a method of learning that occurs through rewards and punishments for behavior, presented by B. F. Skinner.

## [Unsupervised Learning](/examples/unsupervised_learning)
Among the three learning schemes, *unsupervised learning* such as Hebbian learning or self-organization have been autonomously  utilized the most by creatures. Models learn external signals from unsupervised learning to prepare for the external environment or information. In general, unsupervised system is better than supervised system in finding new patterns or features in inputs.

In 1949, Donald O. Hebb argued that "when an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased." This rule is called Hebbian learning; and this synaptic plasticity is thought to be the basic phenomenon in learning and memory.

## [Supervised Learning](/examples/supervised_learning) 
Supervised learning problems can be grouped into regression and classification problems.

- Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category.
- Regression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value.
