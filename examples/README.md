## Introduction
Animals, including humans, change their behavior through experience. It is said that the brain has three types of leaning system: supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised leaning.

The following diagram depicts the basic structure of learning in brains:

## [Reinforcement Learning](/examples/reinforcement_learning)
*Reinforcement Learning* named after operant conditioning, a method of learning that occurs through rewards and punishments for behavior, presented by B. F. Skinner. Skinner studied operant conditioning by conducting animal experiments using a 'Skinner Box' shown in the figure below.

## [Unsupervised Learning](/examples/unsupervised_learning)
Among the three learning structures, *unsupervised learning* such as Hebbian leaning or self-organization have been autonomously  utilized the most by creatures. Models learn external signals from unsupervised learning to prepare for the external environment or information. In general, unsupervised system is better than supervised system in finding new patterns or features in inputs.
