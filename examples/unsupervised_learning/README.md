## GAN
GANs - Generative Adversarial networks - were introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. GANs can create new data by competing two neural networks: *generator* (G) and *discriminator* (D).

## DCGAN
DCGAN - Deep Convolutional GANs - is updated version of GANs presented in 2015. It utilizes convolutional layers along batch normalization and leaky ReLU.

## LSGAN
GANs had problem that learning is unstable. LSGAN - Least Square GANs, which employs least square loss instead of binary cross entropy loss for its loss function was introduced intended to improve the stability of the learning.
