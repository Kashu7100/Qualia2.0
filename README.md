Qualia is a deep learning framework deeply integrated with autograd designed for maximum flexibility. Qualia features in automatic differentiation and dynamic graphing with CUDA acceleration. The previous version is available [here](https://github.com/Kashu7100/Qualia).

## Introduction

David J. Chalmers, an Australian philosopher and cognitive scientist, onece argued that if a system reproduces the functional organization of the brain, it will also reproduce the qualia associated with the brain in the paper "[Absent Qualia, Fading Qualia, Dancing Qualia](http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html)." This library "Qualia" named after the series of arguments in philosophy of mind associated with the qualia, hoping for the creation of a system with subjective consciousness.
