Qualia is a deep learning framework deeply integrated with automatic differentiation and dynamic graphing with CUDA acceleration. Thanks to the define-by-run API, the code written with Qualia enjoys high modularity.

## Introduction
David J. Chalmers, an Australian philosopher and cognitive scientist, onece argued that if a system reproduces the functional organization of the brain, it will also reproduce the qualia associated with the brain in the paper "[Absent Qualia, Fading Qualia, Dancing Qualia](http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html)." This library "Qualia" named after the series of arguments in philosophy of mind associated with the qualia, hoping for the creation of a system with subjective consciousness.
