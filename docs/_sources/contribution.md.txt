## Documentation
When adding a new feature to the framework, the corresponding documentation is required.

To build the documentation, you need to install Sphinx:

```bash
$ pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme nbsphinx
```

Then you can build the documentation in HTML format locally:

```bash
$ ./build_docs.sh
```

HTML files are generated under /html directory. Open `index.html` with the browser and see if it is rendered as expected.
